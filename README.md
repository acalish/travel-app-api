# Go There, Do This!

Go There, Do This! is a travel app that allows authenticated users to log trips.  In the future it will be built out to save more information like activities, restaurants, and general recommendations about locations.

## Test out the app!

To try out the app for yourself, go to the deployed
url: https://acalish.github.io/travel-app-client/

**Username:** demo@demo
**Password:** demo

## Planning and Development Process

My primary focus was to design a simple minimum viable product, and leave a lot of space to grow the app after my initial project sprint deadline.  With only four days, I had to scale down my vision, and then build out future iterations for myself when I have more time.  My current project has two resources, users and trips.  A user has many trips, and a trip belongs to a user.

I began by making sure that I could perform CRUD actions on each resource through curl scripts, and then added the relationship between them.  Once I set up the relationship I again tested through curl that CRUD could still happen.  I also set up my app so that users can only see their own resources.

#### User Stories
As a user I want to sign up, sign in, change my password, sign out.
As a registered user I want to create a new trip that has a destination, start and end dates, and a title (think Amandaâ€™s Wedding or College Reunion).
As a registered user I want to edit my trip.
As a registered user I want to delete my trip.
As a registered user I want to see all of my trips.

### Future Goals
I would like Go There, Do This! to build out into a more robust site in the future.  I want each trip listing to have additional information linked to it, like restaurant and activity recommendations, and maybe lodging and transportation information.  I would also like to incorporate the Yelp API or another travel site to provide more information.  It would also be nice if users could share their trip listings with friends.  I am excited to have so many options of how to expand this app in the future.

I will add more tables and relationships, so trips will have many restaurants, activities, etc.  I would also like to build in a third party API to my backend, and maybe put in a search feature for users to look up information on sites like TripAdvisor or Yelp.

### Challenges
My main challenge for this project was my front end, as it was built with a new framework to me.  I just had to make sure I was not being overly confident working with Ruby on Rails, and make sure to check everything after scaffolding a resource and adding new relationships.

## Set up on localhost
- Fork and clone
- Install dependencies with `bundle install`
- Create a `.env` for sensitive settings (`touch .env`).
- Generate new `development` and `test` secrets (`bundle exec rails secret`).
- Store them in `.env` with keys `SECRET_KEY_BASE_<DEVELOPMENT|TEST>` respectively.

### Setup database
- bin/rails db:create
- bin/rails db:migrate
- Run the API server with `bin/rails server` or `bundle exec rails server`.
